## Tips for Effective Configuration

- **Be Clear on the Tone**: Specify the tone precisely as it influences how the text will be paraphrased, ensuring it aligns with your intentions.
- **Keep Inputs Concise**: While the agent can handle longer texts, shorter entries (up to 300 words) facilitate clearer rephrasing.
- **Experiment with Different Tones**: Don't hesitate to try various tones to see which best fits the context of your text.
- **Review Outputs**: After receiving the paraphrased text, compare it with the original for accuracy and style to ensure it meets your expectations.
- **Iterate**: If the output doesn’t meet your requirements, modify your inputs or tone specifications and run the agent again for improved results.
