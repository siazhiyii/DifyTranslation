The language is polite and encourages the recipient to take action if they have not paid the bill.\n* There are no excessive grammar and spelling errors.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 5\n\nI am very confident in this verdict because the email appears to be a legitimate notification from a company (NJW Limited) about a bill that was due. The language is professional and polite, and the request to view the bill is reasonable. The only potential red flag is the sense of urgency, but it is not aggressive or threatening.
