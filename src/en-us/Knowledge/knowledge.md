# Knowledge

The Knowledge feature enhances the quality of your AI agent's responses by providing valuable information. By adding knowledge, your AI agent can deliver more accurate answers, improve user interactions, and make informed decisions. This feature ensures that your AI agent has access to the essential data needed to serve users effectively.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding Knowledge

Follow these steps to add knowledge to your AI agent:

1. Click on the **Knowledge** option in the left sidebar.
2. Click **"Create"** to initiate a new knowledge set and provide it with a meaningful name.
3. You will be redirected to the file list of the knowledge set you just created.
4. Click **"Add File"** to upload files to this knowledge set. You can upload files in **PDF** or **TXT** format, with a maximum size of 15MB.
   > Note: If you are uploading a PDF file, please note that only text-based PDF formats are supported (i.e., the text within the PDF must be selectable).
5. During the preprocessing step, you can preview how the knowledge will be chunked. Click **"Save and Process"** to continue.
6. You will see the upload and indexing status of your file. Click **"Go to File"** to view your uploaded file.
