# What Types of Knowledge Can I Add to My AI Agent?

You can enhance your AI agent by adding various types of knowledge in the form of documents. Currently, we support the following file formats for upload:

## Supported Formats

- **PDF Files**: You can upload text-based PDF files, which provide structured content for your AI agent to utilize. Ensure that the PDF is readable and that the text can be selected.
  
- **TXT Files**: Plain text files are also supported. These files allow for straightforward content integration without any formatting complications.

## File Size Limitations

Please note that the maximum file size for uploads is **15MB**. Ensure your documents adhere to this limit for successful integration.

## What You Can Do with Knowledge

By adding knowledge in these formats, you enable your AI agent to deliver more accurate responses and improve its ability to assist users effectively.

For more information on how to create knowledge please refer to [Knowledge](/en-us/knowledge/) section.
