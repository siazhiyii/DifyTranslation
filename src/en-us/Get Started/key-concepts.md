# Key Concepts of FabriXAI

## AI Agent

An AI agent is a program designed to autonomously perform tasks and interact with predefined roles. Equipped with prebuilt Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents go beyond natural language processing, offering a wide range of advanced functionalities. They can process information, make decisions, and take actions without human intervention.

AI agents can be deployed across as Web App or Chatbot interfaces, handling complex tasks that range from personal use cases to enterprise-level operations.

## Knowledge

Knowledge serves as the source of information, data, or references that enable your AI agent to accurately complete assigned tasks. It is a powerful tool to equip your agents with the specific insights they need to perform their work effectively. By leveraging knowledge, your agents gain the ability to understand and respond to questions related to specialized topics or domains that may not be covered by their general knowledge.

You can upload a variety of data sources, such as PDFs, TXT files, and more, to enrich your agent's knowledge base.

To learn more about adding knowledge to your agent, visit [Knowledge](/en-us/knowledge/) for detailed instructions.

<!-- ## Power-Ups

Power-Ups are tools that empower your AI agents to seamlessly execute a wide range of functions directly within your local environment, without the need for third-party dependencies. Here are some of the examples of Power-Ups: Calculator, File reader (e.g. txt, md, pdf, doc(x), ppt(x), xls(x), csv, tsv, xml, json), Code executor, Web scrapper, etc. -->


## Templates

Templates are pre-built, ready-to-use AI agents available in FabriXAI. They provide a quick and efficient way to jumpstart the creation of your own AI agents. By cloning a template, you create a customizable copy in your account, granting you full control to modify both the agents and tools to better suit your specific needs.

Explore more options and discover additional templates under [Agent Templates](/en-us/agent-templates/).


## API Keys

API Keys are unique identifiers used to authenticate requests made to an API. They act as a security measure, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific services and data from third-party applications.

Within FabriXAI, API Keys enable seamless integration with a variety of supported third-party services. By using these keys, you can connect your agents and tools to external platforms or your own applications, enhancing their capabilities and enabling more efficient and streamlined workflows.
