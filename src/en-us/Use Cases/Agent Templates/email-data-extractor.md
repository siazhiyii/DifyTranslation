# Email Data Extractor

The **Email Data Extractor** is a specialized AI tool designed to analyze email content and extract relevant information based on specific data fields. Utilizing a structured JSON format, the agent processes email text to identify key elements like the senderâ€™s name, subject, and contact number. In cases where a data field is not found, the extractor automatically assigns the value 'N/A'. This ensures a comprehensive output that caters to both structured and unstructured email content, making it ideal for business communication analysis and data management.


## Getting Started
