# Sensitive Data Filtering Agent

The **Sensitive Data Filtering Agent** is designed to help users safeguard personal information by automatically identifying and obscuring sensitive data within a given text. Targeting specific categories such as HKID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, financial information, and dates of birth, this agent systematically replaces sensitive data with predefined placeholders. Users can maintain the integrity of their communication and compliance with data privacy regulations while ensuring that confidential details are not leaked, making it an invaluable tool for professionals who handle sensitive documents.

## Sample Inputs and Output

### Sample Inputs

```
Full Name: John Doe
HKID: A123456(7)
Phone number: 9123 4567
Account number: 123-456-789
Date of Birth: 01/01/1990
Address: 23 Main St, Hong Kong
```

### Sample Output

```
Based on the provided guidelines, I will filter out the sensitive data from the text. Here is the modified text:

Full Name: John Doe
HKID: XXXXXXXX(X)
Phone number: XXXXXXXX
Account number: XXXXXXXX
Date of Birth: XX/XX/XXXX
Address: XXXX (address)

I replaced the sensitive data as follows:

1. HKID: A123456(7) -> XXXXXXXX(X)
2. Phone number: 9123 4567 -> XXXXXXXX
3. Account number: 123-456-789 -> XXXXXXXX
4. Date of birth: 01/01/1990 -> XX/XX/XXXX
5. Address: 23 Main St, Hong Kong -> XXXX (address)

Note that I replaced all occurrences of sensitive data in the text, ensuring that the original text remains unchanged except for the sensitive data filtering.
