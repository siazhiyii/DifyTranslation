# Prompt Enhancer

The **Prompt Enhancer** is an AI assistant specialized in prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs). It allows users to input initial prompts or review comments, which the agent then refines based on context and clarity. The output includes a polished version of the prompt, an explanation of the adjustments made, and suggestions for further enhancements. This tool is particularly useful for users looking to improve the effectiveness and precision of their prompts, ensuring better interactions with AI models.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have cloned the **Prompt Enhancer**. Follow [Create From Templates](/en-us/create-from-templates/) to clone and configure your AI agent.


## Configuration Instructions

### Knowledge

You can upload `.pdf` or `.txt` files to provide the agent with tailored context that meets your specific requirements.

## Sample Inputs and Output

### Sample Inputs

```
Help me generate a reply email to my client who is complaining about our services.
```

### Sample Output

````
Refined Prompt:
Generate a reply email to [{} client name] regarding their complaint about [{} service issue] (e.g. delayed delivery, poor customer support, billing error).

Explanation of Refinement:
The original prompt is clear but lacks specificity. By adding the brackets and examples, we provide more context and make it easier for the AI to generate a relevant and empathetic response.

Suggestions for Further Refinement:

Consider adding more details about the client's previous interactions or communication history to help tailor the response.
You may also want to specify the tone of the email (e.g. apologetic, solution-focused, neutral) to ensure the AI generates a response that aligns with your desired approach.
Example with additional refinement:
Generate a reply email to [{} client name] regarding their complaint about [{} service issue] (e.g. delayed delivery, poor customer support, billing error), with a tone of [{} tone] (e.g. apologetic, solution-focused, neutral).

Reply Email:
