# AI Code Tutor

The **AI Code Tutor** is an intelligent assistant designed to help users understand programming code. By analyzing code snippets provided by the user, the agent offers a comprehensive overview of what the code does, followed by a detailed, step-by-step explanation of each part. Additionally, it suggests related programming topics for further learning, enabling users to build a stronger foundation in coding concepts. Whether you are a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, the AI Code Tutor will guide you through the intricacies of programming languages and concepts.


## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have cloned the **AI Code Tutor**. Follow [Create From Templates](/en-us/create-from-templates/) to clone and configure your AI agent.


## Configuration Instructions

### User Inputs

No input fields are required for these AI agents.

### Knowledge

You can upload `.pdf` or `.txt` files to provide the agent with tailored context that meets your specific requirements.

### AI Models

The default model is *Llama 3.1 8B Instruct*, but you can explore other supported AI models as well. If needed, refine your prompts for more tailored outputs.

## Sample Inputs and Output

### Sample Inputs

```
The code block:

import time
t = time.localtime()
current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", t)
print(current_time)
```

### Sample Output

```
Overview

This code block retrieves the current time and prints it in the format "HH:MM:SS". It uses the time module in Python to achieve this.

Step-by-Step Explanation

import time: This line imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions. By importing the module, we can use its functions in our code. Note: The backslash (\) at the end of the line is a line continuation character in Python, which allows us to break a long line into multiple lines for readability.
t = time.localtime(): This line retrieves the current time as a struct_time object, which is a tuple-like object containing the current time in a specific format. The localtime() function returns the local time, which is the time in the system's local time zone.
current_time = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", t): This line formats the current time into a string in the format "HH:MM:SS". The strftime() function takes two arguments: a format string and a time object. The format string "%H:%M:%S" specifies the format of the output string:
%H: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
%M: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.
%S: Second as a zero-padded decimal number.
print(current_time): This line prints the formatted current time to the console.
Related Topics

To deepen your understanding of this code, you may want to explore the following topics:

Time zones: The localtime() function returns the local time, but what if you want to work with time zones? You can use the timezone module to work with time zones.
Date and time formatting: The strftime() function is just one way to format dates and times. You can also use the datetime module to work with dates and times in a more object-oriented way.
Error handling: What if the time module is not available or the localtime() function fails? You can use try-except blocks to handle errors and exceptions.
String formatting: The strftime() function uses a format string to format the output string. You can also use the format() method or f-strings to format strings in Python.
Some recommended resources to learn more about these topics include:

## Tips of Effective Configuration

- **Understand the Agent's Purpose**: Familiarize yourself with how the AI Code Tutor analyzes and explains code to make the most of its capabilities.
- **Provide Clear Code Snippets**: Ensure that the code you input is clear and complete to receive the most accurate explanations.
- **Leverage Related Topics**: Pay attention to the suggested related topics to deepen your understanding of programming concepts and improve your coding skills.
- **Experiment with Different Code Samples**: Test various programming languages and structures to explore the agent's versatility and depth of knowledge.
- **Refine Your Prompts**: If the explanations are not detailed enough, try providing more context or asking specific questions about the code.
